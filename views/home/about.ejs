        <h2>What is the Rigveda?</h2>
        <p>
            The Rigveda is the oldest surviving Indo-European text and the oldest of the four Vedas—the foundational sacred texts of Hinduism. Composed in Vedic Sanskrit between roughly 1500-1200 BCE, it contains 1,028 hymns organized into 10 books (Mandalas), each addressing various deities and cosmic principles.
        </p>
        <p>
            These hymns were passed down orally through generations with remarkable precision before being committed to writing. They form the spiritual and philosophical foundation of Hindu thought, exploring themes of creation, sacrifice, cosmic order (Rita), and the relationship between mortals and divine forces.

        <h2>Why Veda-Dive?</h2>
        <p>
            The Rigveda is an immense and complex text. Its poetry is layered with metaphor, ritual significance, and philosophical depth—making it challenging to approach for modern readers. Traditional translations can feel distant, disconnected from the sensory and emotional world the hymns describe.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Veda-Dive</strong> reimagines this ancient text through an interactive, multimedia lens. By combining textual analysis, thematic exploration, and atmospheric visualization, we aim to bridge the gap between ancient wisdom and contemporary understanding.

        <h2>A Note on Interpretation</h2>
        <p>
            The Rigveda is a text open to multiple interpretations. Scholars disagree on translations, meanings, and historical context. This platform presents one scholarly approach, but we encourage exploration of different perspectives and deeper study.

            For devotional purposes, please refer to traditional commentaries (like those by Sayana) and teachings from established Hindu philosophical schools.
